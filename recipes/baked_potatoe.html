        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>A perfect baked potato is hard to beat. The outside is brown and crisp, coated in a crust of sea salt. Pierce the skin, and your fork gives way to a soft, fluffy interior. It might be hard to resist eating the whole thing straight out of the oven, but if you take the time to top it with a pat of butter or a dollop of (cashew) sour cream, you won’t be able to deny that it was worth the wait.</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium russet potatoes</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Use a fork to poke a few holes into the potatoes. Place on the baking sheet, rub with olive oil, and sprinkle liberally with sea salt all over. Bake 45 to 60 minutes, or until the potato is fork-tender and the skin is crisp.</li>
            <li>Slice open each potato, fluff the insides, and serve with desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
